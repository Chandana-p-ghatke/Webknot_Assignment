Well, from this project i've learnt like how the backend operations work, like how a event can be managed efficiently and also about the things like how backend operation allows students to register for and attend events, as well as provide feedback and all.
With the help of Anaconda navigator(Spyder,Anaconda prompt), Chatgpt, draw.io,  Python and Flask for backend API development, with SQLite as the database i've completed this assignment.
To be honest i really enjoyed this learning journey, it was different from all other assignment. I would be much more happier to work as Webknight.
